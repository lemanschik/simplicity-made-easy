# simplicity-made-easy
A book about simple things that are maybe not as easy but simple in ECMAScript.

A person once suggested to me a talk and today i want to port that talk over to ECMAScript to improve the knowleg about ECMAScript Engines.
They in fact drive the world for good reason. They are simple and not easy. This book trys to get you familar with the != between simple and easy. 

the most easy example is maybe webpack it is a great fit as also typescript both are easy to use you install run adjust some config you are done. 

you created guard rails via tests and a test framework because why not drive against a wall before you hit your target?!?.

So lets show how easy the tools are just follow the docs round about 30 pages of small printed text so easy to grasp around right?

Ok so we are on page. 


lets explain now what they simple do:
- replace text in strings following conditional rules. As also break and error and simply stop working. they call that linting. 
- write the modified text in one or more files also copy some binary additional files.
- What else? i am not aware of something else prove me wrong. 

- the best typescript and webpack features are you never know if the error is caused by you or them that is a extra bonus you can easy look that up
  - start your debugger session and start investigating most best is when you also put electron into the chain then you add some extra complexity. 
  - hope you get what we are talking about here it is so easy right? lets use vscode which runs inside electron lets connect debuggers before that we read about 100 pages and the links they reference that was easy took us 1 week we found out ok it is a upstream error now we raise a issue in the upstream
  - then our employer told us we are fired because he has no money any more deadline not reached because used best tools and practices. 

does the above sound familar?

ok so i hope we are on page i did reduce the documentation of webpack and typescript now into 3 main parts they are simple but not easy.

so when we look now in one of the code bases lets take typescript as they show how easy it is to make simple mistakes. They use inheritence all over so they did the main failure of applying classes and structures around Data we call that ORM/OMG you can only do one thing with data in general. And that is ruin it so if you do not ruin the data you safed a lot of frustration on the long run.
