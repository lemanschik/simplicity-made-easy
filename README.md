# simplicity-made-easy
A book about simple things that are maybe not as easy but simple in ECMAScript.

A person once suggested to me a talk and today i want to port that talk over to ECMAScript to improve the knowleg about ECMAScript Engines.
They in fact drive the world for good reason. They are simple and not easy. This book trys to get you familar with the != between simple and easy. 

the most easy example is maybe webpack it is a great fit as also typescript both are easy to use you install run adjust some config you are done. 

you created guard rails via tests and a test framework because why not drive against a wall before you hit your target?!?.

So lets show how easy the tools are just follow the docs round about 30 pages of small printed text so easy to grasp around right?

Ok so we are on page. 


lets explain now what they simple do:
- replace text in strings following conditional rules. As also break and error and simply stop working. they call that linting. 
- write the modified text in one or more files also copy some binary additional files.
- What else? i am not aware of something else prove me wrong. 

ok so i hope we are on page i did reduce the documentation of webpack and typescript now into 3 main parts they are simple but not easy.
